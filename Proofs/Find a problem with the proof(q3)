We will prove that in every finite collection of natural numbers all of the numbers are equal, using induction in the number of
natural numbers in the collection:
The statement is true for any collection with just one natural number,a, for a=a.
Now suppose it is true for any collection n of natural numbers.
Let a1,a2,...an,an+1 be any collection of n+1 natural numbers.
By induction hypothesis, a1=a2=a3=...=an. But also we have a2=...=an=an+1, because here, too, there are only n numbers. And so 
a1=a2=...=an=an+1.
What is wrong with this 'proof'?

This statement is true for n = 1, A(1) - the basis of induction; it is also true for n > 2, if A(n), then A(n+1) as was proven abobe. But for n = 2  we have a degenerated chain of equalities: a1 = ... = an and a2 = ... = an+1 for n = 2 turn into a1 = a1 and a2 = a2.  From these two equalities doesn't follow that a1 = a2. So, if A(1), then is not A(2), and given proof is also false.
