a. To be sure you understand proof that square root of 2 is not rational, prove that square root of 7 is not rational. Then 
show there are arbitrary many irrational numbers.

Let  √7 be rational. Then  √7=p/q, where p/q is in lower terms.

Then :

This means that p squared is divisible by 7 and so is p. Then there exists s, so that:

<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p=7s\Rightarrow{p^{2}=49s^{2}\Rightarrow 49s^{2}=7q^{2}\Rightarrow 7s^{2}=q^{2}" border="0"/>
This means that q squared is divisible by 7 and so is q. Both q and p are divisible by 7, which means that  √7=p/q  is a false assumption.

To show that there are arbitrary many irrational numbers we can just take the above proof and replace all 7`s with any prime (not composite) number p. (For a composite number, which is not a perfect square, the proof will be more complicated).
Voila, we have infinitely many irrational numbers.

b. Construct line segments corresponding to  √2,  √3,  √4,  √5 using straightedge and compass: (Hint: Use Pythagoras`s theorem).

In order to construct such segment for  √2 we simply need to use straightedge to draw a right isosceles triangle with 
two legs equal to 1. Then the hypotenuse will be equal to  √2. Then we can use compass to measure  √2 from our previous picture. Therefore, we can construct right triangle with legs equal to 1 and  √2, then the hypotenuse will be equal to  √3.
√4 is equal to 2, so we can simply contruct it without building right triangles whatsoever. To obtain a line segment of length
√5 we can again build a right triangle with legs  √2 and  √3, as these lengths are already in our posession from earlier
solutions. 

c. How do we represent irrational numbers in our system of decimal notations?

Irrational numbers have decimal expansions that neither terminate nor end with a repeating sequence.

The set of irrational numbers can be partitioned into two subsets: transcendental numbers and algebraic numbers. A transcendental number is a complex number that is not an algebraic number — that is, not a root of a nonzero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. The best-known transcendental numbers are π and e. The n-th roots of an integer number belong to algebraic numbers, the set of which is countable.
