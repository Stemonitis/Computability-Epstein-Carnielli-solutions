Show that if f has a primitive recursive function, then there are arbitrarily (countably) many other primitive recursive 
definitions that give rise to f.

f(x)=d
f(x+1)=g(f(x))

Because we can allow endless composition of functions, we can apply any number of inverse functions to any already defined 
function. For example:

P(S(S(S(x))))=S(S(x)) and etc.
