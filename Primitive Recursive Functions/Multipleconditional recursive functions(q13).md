Suppose we have countably many primitive recursive conditions A1, ... An,... such that every x satisfies exactly one of these. 
And suppose we also have countably many primitive recursive functions h1, ..., hn, ... . Let f be defined by f(x)=hn(x) if An
is satisfied by x. Is f necessarily primitive recursive? Give a proof or a counterexample with appropriate restrictions. 

We have shown before that Odd is primitive recursive. This is an example. By definition f would be primitive recursive if it 
can be derived from a primitive recursive functions and be assigned a certain number n. So, if the conditions are primitive
recursive, so that they can be viewed or constructed as primitive recursive function (e.g. "Odd" function) and be composed to 
form a with a recursive function, then by definition f would be primitive recursive and otherwise not. 
So the only problem is that we have an infinite number of functions or conditions. In this case we won`t be able to exactly 
assign this function a number and it will not be primitive recursive.
