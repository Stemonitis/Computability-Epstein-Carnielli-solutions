Give one application of definition by conditions and one by bounded minimization which show the utility of knowing that these operations are primitive 
recursive.

These definitions are extremely useful, because it is much easier to define other primitive recursive functions, especially while programming, when you do not 
want to enter the infinite loop. 
Also, bounded minimization is important tool that can be used in proofs and also if we know it is primitive recursive, we can show that these proofs are in 
fact turing machine computable and do not halt at some point,
