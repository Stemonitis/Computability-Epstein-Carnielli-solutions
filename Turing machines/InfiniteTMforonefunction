Prove that if the function is TM computable, then there are infinitely many different Turing machines that calculate it.

For every code for the TM we can add infinitely many extra steps in the beginning or end to just move the machine to the right
and back, or left and back or erase and write back 0s and 1s. This will not change the output of the function, but the TM
will be different. As there are infinetely many times and ways we can do that, then there are infinitely many different TMs
to calculate the same function.
