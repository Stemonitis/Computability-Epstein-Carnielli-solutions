The Busy Beaver Problem

This problem was proposed by T.Rado in 1962 in order to give a concrete example of a function that is not TM computable.

Given a TM, define it`s productivity to be the number of 1`s in the tape if it halts in a standart configuration starting from
a blank tape and 0 otherwise. For each n>=1 we define p(n) to be the maximal productivity of any machine with n states.

a. Show that p(1)>=1.
b. Show that p(n+11)>=2n. (Hint: See Example 3).
c. Show that p(n+1)>p(n).
Conclude that for all i,j, if p(i)>=p(j), then i>=j.
d. Show that if there exists a TM P with k states that computes the function p, then p(n+2+2k)>=p[p(n)].
(Hint: connect P twice with the machine Tn of Example 1, which writes n 1`s on a blank tape (suggestively) P[P(Tn)].)
e. Conclude that p is not TM computable.
(Hint: p(n+13+2k)>=p[p(n+11)]) and then apply parts (c) and (b) to get a contradiction.)
